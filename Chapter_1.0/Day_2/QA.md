-What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?

The 5 pillars of Cadence are "Safety and Security", "Clarity", "Approachability", "Developer Experience", and "Resource Oriented Programming".

-In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?

"Safety and Security" is an important pillar because if this was not the case then it would be vulnerable to hacking and people taking advantage of loopholes to make the contracts do things that are unintended.  Without being secure, it could cause people to lose faith in the product.
"Clarity" is useful to allow users to see if there are problems in the code which could cause unintended issues or security issues.
"Approachability" allows more people to develop on Cadence and allow the product grow faster, and develop new features faster.  Also without a huge learning curve, and more people using it, this allows for a greater variety of coding/features.
"Developer Experience" is useful to allow the developer to find issues with their code and be able to fix problems faster, this will help in speeding up the release process of the code.
